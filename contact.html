<h2>Email Contact</h2>

I respond to email 2-3 times per day, I prefer to limit my email distraction time as much as possible, as it results in me getting more done per day. Nevertheless, feel free to contact me via <a href="mailto:Stephen@rixi.us">Stephen Middleton &lt;Stephen@rixi.us&gt;</a>

<h2>Telephone Contact</h2>

I'm not against contact over the phone, but request that you contact me via email first, so that we may plan a time to ensure that I'm not busy. If you already have my number, and it is an urgent issue, please feel free to call without discussion, I want to help solve whatever issue as quickly as possible.

<h2>Online Chat Contact</h2>
I'm usually online on IRC, and I can be found most days on the <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net">Freenode Network</a>. /msg me, or ping me in one of the various channels that I lurk in.
