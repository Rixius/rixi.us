I've been under a rock. And by Under a rock, I mean busy as hell.
I'm making time to write this weekend, but I don't know when I'll push it up to Heroku to be live.

I've messed around a bit with PGP and my SSH keys and such, this time in an intelligent way.
Last time I started down this rabbit hole, I followed some tutorial blindly, and [A key that was mine that has lost access to the private key long ago.][pgp_key]
The private key for that pair is long gone, likely deleted off some hard drive somewhere.
But I uploaded it while blindly following instructions, so it's out there. With no signatures, just floating.
This time, I bought a nice, compact 32GB Flash drive, that houses my PGP Key-pair, and a new SSH key, both of which have nice solid passphrases, and I can pull it out and put it in my pocket.
I have also generated a revocation certificate to this, and will be printing it out and storing it away.

I've been working hard, while keeping up with lovely doctor's appointments. I'm dealing with a new Neurologist, and by the current tests, What looked really bleak and depressing might not be as bad as it seemed.
I still have trouble walking up stairs too fast, down as well. And I cna't walk /too/ far or fast without getting winded.
But I'm about back up to 70% or so, which is amazing.

I'll be attending [Texas Linux Festival][TXLF], [PaizoCon][PaizoCon], and [Anime Fest][AFest] this year.
And if possible, I'd like to attend [GenCon][GenCon] this year.

In a short while, I'll put my Public Key up here, so I can encourage PGP communication in my [/contact][contact]
