    Hello, World~!
There, I've said it now.

For a while, I've needed a good place to jot down my thoughts. I've been working on a variety of projects in m unfortunate downtime due to medical problems, but now that I'm active again(able to walk a mile without keeling over) I'm going to start writing more about the computer science that I've been dallying about with.

I begun teaching myself computer science in late 2008, developing a webcomic site in PHP. When I started learning about the beautiful features in Javascript, such as annonymous functions, and its lexical scoping, I fell in love with Computer Science as a field of study. I started branching out into other languages, and since have taught myself Ruby, Python, and Perl. I am in the process of learning C, C++, Java, Lisp, and APL. My favorint thing about Programming is studying how different languages handle similar problems differently and why they chose to go about the way they do.

I've been teaching myself C, to get a head into the lower-level stuff. I have a laptop that's ancient(about 7 years old) so I installed a GUI-less install of Debian, and just work from the command line. With the benefit of the FrameBuffer in the Linux Kernel, I can even view pictures, or play video from the command line~

I intend to begin a Open Source project developing a Game Boy emulator to display onto the FrameBuffer, so that I may begin playing games on this laptop as well. I'll keep a dev diary of sorts here.
