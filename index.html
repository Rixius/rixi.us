My website should be friendly to all Free Software web browsers, even text-based browsers. 
It looks bad, because I am not a designer, I am a developer. 
My forté lies in implementing more creative people's deisgns in a web environment, and implementing and maintaining the backend, where all the data is handled. 
Database query speed, server response times, and browser load speed are the things that I dig over. 
All the code behind the site can be found at <a href="https://gitorious.org/rixius/rixius">https://gitorious.org/rixius/rixius</a>
